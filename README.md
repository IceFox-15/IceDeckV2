## Inspiration
I was inspirated by the Streamdeck and decided to make my own, adjusted to my purposes. I first thought about what buttons I would need and then started sketching. I added 2 buttons for Discord, 5 buttons for Spotify and still have two left, which i'll find a purpose for someday. Then I also added a screen for the time or gifs/memes and a volumeknob. Also my README is based on the layout of Ducc's Fidget Toy by Dongathan-Jong.

## Challanges
It was hard to find the go with KiCad, bc I was using it for the first time. It was especially difficult to find a scheme and footprint of the screen module, I ended up making my own.
